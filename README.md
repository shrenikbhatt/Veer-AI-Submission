# Veer-AI-Submission

This project includes a Django backend alongside a React frontend.

## Installation

First, clone the repo and navigate to the Veer-AI-Submission folder on your machine using terminal.
```bash
git clone [repo-link]
```
Now, you will have to create a virtual environment (recommended) in order to isolate the module installation. For MacOS and Linux, the commands are:
```bash
python -m pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```
For Windows:
```bash
python -m pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env
env\Source\activate
```

Now, you must install the required modules for the Django application. With the virtual environment activated, navigate to the directory containing the requirements.txt file and type.
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This should install all required modules onto your machine.
